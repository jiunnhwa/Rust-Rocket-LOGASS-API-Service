# Rust-Rocket-LOGASS-API-Service
Rocket Rust microservice to provide Logging-As-A-Service using JSON API calls. This is analogous to the previous LOGASS application written in GoLang.

This project is meant to be a comparative to the same logging application written in golang, as well as getting to learn Rust.
